There’s a concerning correlation between where you live and how long you’ll live.

According to the WHO, 24% of all estimated global deaths are linked to where someone lives. Continuing our society's mass ignorance and inaction furthers the disparities between communities.
Envirome lets people see for themselves why environment and location matter most in the fight for equity and justice.


Envirome's mission is to raise awareness and inspire users to take action in their own communities to mitigate health issues that are impacted by environmental factors. The world is rapidly changing, and it's time no one, not just the wealthy and those who can afford to live within gated communities, is left behind.
